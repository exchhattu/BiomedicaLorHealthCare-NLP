    "## Overview\n",
    "Biomedical text mining is important because it provides useful information relevant to human health. This can directly benefit the healthcare industry (biotech, pharmaceutical, and insurance) and the public.  Here, the goal is to curate the unstructured data and to identify biological entities such as disease name, gene/protein, and chemical name using deep learning methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "### Manually curated data\n",
    "This is a daunting task because they are labor-intensive,  time-consuming and required domain knowledge. Thus, the size of the dataset is very small.  \n",

    "## Transfer Learning\n",
    "Annotation of a biomedical entity using automated methods can overcome the drawback of manual curation in terms of speed up but it reduces accuracy. On the other hand, transfer learning can provide an alternative approach in which the knowledge of uncurated or automatically parsed data can be used to learn with a manually created target. It overcomes the data scarcity and generalizes in the model to achieve superior performance. The idea is successfully implemented in many domains (speech recognition, finance, and computer vision) using a deep neural network.    "
